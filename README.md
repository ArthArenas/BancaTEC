# BancaTEC
A second semester project from my Object-Oriented Programming course. This program runs an ATM that manages money transactions of clients and its accounts.

The program specifications were provided by my teacher. However, the document was removed from the platform (Blackboard) at the end of the semester and will be uploaded later.
